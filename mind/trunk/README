There are some keywords nearly every routine does understand:

STOP : stops at neuralgic points of execution
WAIT : waits for keyword interaction at important points

NOGRAPHIC : suppresses graphics
PS        : saves graphics as postscript
EPS       : saves graphics as encapsualted postscript
NEWWIN    : forgets old windows (eg. leaving them untouched)
            and opens everything new (useful if the sheet 
            stuff is confused)
