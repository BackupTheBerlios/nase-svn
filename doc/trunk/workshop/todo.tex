\section{How to use this file}

The to-do-list is maintained by the NASE developers. The HTML-page you
are viewing is automatically generated from a LaTeX file, which is
under CVS control. Each developer may check out, modify, and check in
this list. To retrieve a local copy, use "\texttt{cvs checkout todo}".
This will get you a copy of the LaTeX file, as well as the
\texttt{bugs} subdirectory from the normal NASE tree.
    
If you discover a bug in a NASE routine or any issue that should be
looked after, please try to go and have it fixed right away. If this
is not possible at that moment, put a short description of the issue
into this list. You may create new sections as appropriate. If you
discovered a bug, please create a short, commented program that
reproduces it, and put it into the \texttt{bugs} directory.

If you are bored, refer to this list and resolve as many issues as
possible \texttt{;-)}. As soon as an issue is resolved, move it from
its current position in the list to the "Fulfilled ToDos" section
below.

Please note that most LaTeX commands and environments are either not supported by
htmllatex or our stylesheet and cannot be used in this file (this is
listed as a bug to resolve below.)

Thank you!\\

\section{Help System \& Documentation Header} 
\begin{itemize}
\item most LaTeX commands and environments are either not supported by
  htmllatex or our stylesheet.
\item standards Makefile broken for non-saam environment
\item move Traps and Bugs into the standards document
\item \texttt{WhoUses} doesn't work and its wrapper calls routine with wrong path.
\item Parser confuses occasional \texttt{NAME::}--keywords with name
  of the routine given by the \texttt{NAME:} statement in the header.
\item nasecvscommit.ps-File seems to be broken (see my mail to the
  NASE-list from aug-15-2003): In the "nase" CVS module, syntax check
  seems to pass always. In the "CVSROOT" CVS module, the script fails,
  causing CVS to cancel the commit process. This prevents checking in
  of any CVS administration files!
  For a workaround to this problem, see the mail.
\end{itemize}



\section{Control}
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{console} fails, if xwindow id closed and a console command occurs
\item \texttt{console} should not be the son of !MH
\item \texttt{Video}: extension to save and restore arbitrary parameter structures
\end{itemize}


\section{Graphic}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{UTvScl}:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Handling of 1-dim arrays is broken.
      \item Handling of arrays with trailing dimensions of 1 is broken.
      \item When /POLY is set, and only one positioning-argument is given,
        it is interpreted as the x-coordinate, and y defaults to zero.
        This is wrong, positions in the window should be counted in this
        case, see documentation of IDL's TV or POLY=0-behaviour.
      \item Now that UTvScl does hndling of !NONEs, it would really by
        nice, if they could be preserved when using CUBIC or INTERP.
        Currently, interpolation breaks handling of !NONEs. Idea: resize
        separate array of nones, and imprint it on the result. Or: Use
        value that stays unchaned during interpolation, e.g. !NaN. Would
        be elegant, but then !NaN must not be contained for other reasons!
    \end{itemize}
  \item \texttt{Examineit}:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item ``bound'' display type fails when array contains !NONE
        (value -999999).
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


\section{Methods}
\begin{itemize}
\item Nothing to do here at the moment.
\end{itemize}


\section{MIND}
\begin{itemize}
\item simulation and analysis routines save their evaluation parameters via \texttt{Video}s
\item allow deletion of unnecessary tags
\item external learning rules should display relevant information
\item display iteration time in \texttt{console} instead of terminal
\item Plotting input with /NASE option should be possible
\item Only plot changing inputs or use \texttt{PlotTvScl_Update}.
\end{itemize}



\section{Misc}
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{StrJoin}: remove or maintain due to IDL 3.6?
\item \texttt{Split}: bug when working with separator longer than 1 character
\item How can marburg specific extensions be included?
\item \texttt{XMatEdit}: obsolete 
\item \texttt{UOpenR} and partners should use IDLs streaming ZIP functionality.
WARNING: IDL is only able to zip since V5.3!
\end{itemize}




\section{Simulation Kernel}
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{saveDW} and \texttt{restoreDW} should work with \texttt{SDW}
\item initialize T2C on demand and in a separate function
\item extend \texttt{initDW} to work \texttt{SLOW} and \texttt{FAST} version
\item check the functionality of weight display routines, when T2C is missing
\item \texttt{N_Spikes} and \texttt{LayerMUA} are redundant. Current status: \texttt{N_Spikes} uses \texttt{LayerMUA} and generates warning.
\item \texttt{SetWeights} new version doesnt delete \texttt{!NONE} connections properly.
\end{itemize}



\section{Fulfilled ToDos}
\label{sec:fulfilled}
\begin{itemize}

\item \texttt{DelayWeigh}: improvement in processing speed and memory consumption? NOPE [done]

\item \texttt{PlotTvScl}: PS and NASE option broken [i think ruediger fixed this, MS] 
\item \texttt{PlotTvScl}: legend only approximately identical with actual coordinate system [see new routine PTVS, done, MS]
\item \texttt{SimTime}: make it work together with console [done, AT] 
\item \texttt{RealFileName}: marburg specific actions brake other systems [done, AT]
\item \texttt{floatWeigh}: commit, leave a message in \texttt{delayWeigh} to perform all changes in \texttt{floatWeigh} as well [FloatWeigh function is now included in DelayWeigh, AT].
\item The To Do--list on the WWW page needs to be updated by
  hand. [done, now updated automatically, RK]
\end{itemize}
